1. cubic spline fit to continuum, include discontinuities
2. overall fit in chunks, 20 or so lines at a time
3. calculate uncertainty internal to model as well as external
4. stop based on convergence, not on simple number of iterations 
5. ion identification in output line list
6. latex tables option
7. change "width" fitting to "resolution"
