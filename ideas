Questions:
  why doesn't the maximum RMS end up very close to the minimum RMS?  Where are the large values coming from?
  why doesn't it converge to a very stable value? - mutations too strong?
  why doesn't it work on a whole spectrum even with 100,000 generations?
    goodness of fit weighted towards strong lines
    wavelength calibration not robust enough to fit whole thing

possible algorithm:
 1. fit strong lines to get first estimate of redshift and resolution
 2. then fit in chunks, restrict the mutation to say 5% of the initial values
 3. allow each line to have its own redshift?

single line list, strong lines marked somehow

tests:
  make synthetic spectrum with a few weak lines and one strong line.  increase strength of strong line.  determine if contrast alone causes bad fitting of weak lines.  if it does, then goodness of fit needs improving

0. uncertainties:
     generate synthetic spectra with one line and increasing noise
     fit with dipso
     fit with alfa, compare, use to diagnose correct uncertainty calculation
1. continuum:
    - include discontinuities
    - try fourier transform, remove lowest frequency information, invert
2. overall fit in chunks, 20 or so lines at a time
    - fit strongest lines to estimate redshift and resolution
    - restrict the variation of these and then fit all the lines in chunks
    - maybe two or three stages - mask out lines in three stages to see how deep a line list should be fitted
3. calculate uncertainty internal to model as well as external
4. stop based on convergence, not on simple number of iterations 
   set target rms based on rms in continuum
5. use cfitsio to read in fits files
6. command line options:
     min and max wavelength
     initial guess of redshift and resolution
7. allow choice of fitting with constant width or constant resolution
