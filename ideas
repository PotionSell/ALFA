write out balmer jump fluxes
combine blended lines afterwards
 - find lines separated by less than the instrumental resolution
 - add their fluxes
 - list them as blends in the output table

Questions:
  why doesn't the maximum RMS end up very close to the minimum RMS?  Where are the large values coming from?

tests:
  make synthetic spectrum with a few weak lines and one strong line.  increase strength of strong line.  determine if contrast alone causes bad fitting of weak lines.  if it does, then goodness of fit needs improving

0. uncertainties:
     generate synthetic spectra with one line and increasing noise
     fit with dipso
     fit with alfa, compare, use to diagnose correct uncertainty calculation
1. continuum:
    - include discontinuities
    - try fourier transform, remove lowest frequency information, invert
2. calculate uncertainty internal to model as well as external
3. stop based on convergence, not on simple number of iterations 
   set target rms based on rms in continuum
4. use cfitsio to read in fits files
5. command line options:
     min and max wavelength
     initial guess of redshift and resolution
6. allow choice of fitting with constant width or constant resolution
