change redshift units - 1+v/c is too sensitive to mutation function and restrictions.

breed, mutate, fitness, select
Questions:
  why doesn't the maximum RMS end up very close to the minimum RMS?  Where are the large values coming from?
  why doesn't it converge to a very stable value? - mutations too strong?
  why doesn't it work well on a whole spectrum even with 100,000 generations?
    goodness of fit weighted towards strong lines
    wavelength calibration not robust enough to fit whole thing

single line list, strong lines marked somehow

tests:
  make synthetic spectrum with a few weak lines and one strong line.  increase strength of strong line.  determine if contrast alone causes bad fitting of weak lines.  if it does, then goodness of fit needs improving

0. uncertainties:
     generate synthetic spectra with one line and increasing noise
     fit with dipso
     fit with alfa, compare, use to diagnose correct uncertainty calculation
1. continuum:
    - include discontinuities
    - try fourier transform, remove lowest frequency information, invert
2. calculate uncertainty internal to model as well as external
3. stop based on convergence, not on simple number of iterations 
   set target rms based on rms in continuum
4. use cfitsio to read in fits files
5. command line options:
     min and max wavelength
     initial guess of redshift and resolution
6. allow choice of fitting with constant width or constant resolution
