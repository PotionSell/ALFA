1. uncertainties:
     generate synthetic spectra with one line and increasing noise
     fit with dipso
     fit with alfa, compare, use to diagnose correct uncertainty calculation
2. continuum:
    - try fourier transform, remove lowest frequency information, invert
    - try calculating gradients to mask lines
    - first differencing
3. use first differences to identify unfitted lines, take the top few differences which are not near fitted lines and report them
4. sort out the issue of lines falling outside the chunk.
5. allow more parameters to be set on command line
     continuum window, npoints
     generations, pop size, pressure
6. fix reading of 1D fits files
