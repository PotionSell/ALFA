1. cubic spline fit to continuum, include discontinuities
    or try fourier transform, remove lowest frequency information, invert
2. overall fit in chunks, 20 or so lines at a time
3. calculate uncertainty internal to model as well as external
4. stop based on convergence, not on simple number of iterations 
   set target rms based on rms in continuum
5. ion identification in output line list, use better file names
6. latex tables option
7. use cfitsio to read in fits files
8. allow initial guess of redshift and resolution to be specified
