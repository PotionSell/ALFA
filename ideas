write out balmer jump fluxes

0. uncertainties:
     generate synthetic spectra with one line and increasing noise
     fit with dipso
     fit with alfa, compare, use to diagnose correct uncertainty calculation
1. continuum:
    - include discontinuities
    - try fourier transform, remove lowest frequency information, invert
    - try calculating gradients to mask lines
2. calculate uncertainty internal to model as well as external
3. stop based on convergence, not on simple number of iterations 
   set target rms based on rms in continuum
4. use cfitsio to read in fits files
5. command line options:
     min and max wavelength
     initial guess of redshift and resolution
6. allow choice of fitting with constant width or constant resolution
